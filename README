     --~~ About ~~--
     
     Prowl rocks! It's a webapp and a iPhone app that works
     together and lets you send push notifications via HTTP
     to any iPhone that has the prowl app installed.
     
          Prowl.send({
            :application => "World Saving Project Manager",
            :event => "Canceled",
            :description => "It sucked, so I canceled it. Sorry :(",
            :apikey => "abc123def456"
          })

      The user has given you its API key. That lets you
      send push notifications to the users iPhone, through
      the Prowl iPhone app.
      
      
      --~~ Usage ~~--
      
      Three required parameters:
      
          :application
          :event
          :description
          
      Other than that, you're free to choose from any of these
      highly convenient methods.
      
      Prowl.send("apikey", :application => "Foo", ...)
      Prowl.send("username", "password", :application => "Foo", ...)
      
      p = Prowl.new("username", "password")
      p.send(...)
      
      p = Prowl.new("apikey123abc")
      p.send(...)
